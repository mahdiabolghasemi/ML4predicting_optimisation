This repository contains the codes and data for the paper "Machine learning to support operational decision making in the blood supply chain: analysis of the loss function selection".

Data are stored in Demand2.xlsx and ZINB files. Demand 2 contains the blood demands for each hospital over 18500 days that are resulted from Zero Inflated Negative Binomail (ZINB) distribution. To see the deatils of how we obtained this data, please read "Dehghani, M., Abbasi, B., Oliveira, F., 2021. Proactive transshipment in the blood supply chain: A stochastic programming approach. Omega 98, 102112". 

The LGB script contains the LGBM model implemented in the paper.
